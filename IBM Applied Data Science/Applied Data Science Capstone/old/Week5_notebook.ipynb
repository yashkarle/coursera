    "The primary focus for this project would be on the city Dublin and its 22 different District areas.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project tries to achieve the following analyses for the respective target audience in mind:  \n",
    "1) **House Renting**: Finding an apartment to rent in Dublin city is very challenging given the housing crisis. The target audience in this case is people looking for rental apartments in the city. The attempt here is to filter out properties based on user preferences for apartment characteristics, neighborhood choices, pricing and crime rate in the neighborhood in which the property is situated.  \n",
    "2) **Neighborhood Clustering**: The approach here is to use visualization techniques to cluster districts within Dublin city using clustering techniques based on the venues and venue categories present in different districts. We can get a sense of how different districts are oriented within the city in terms of different places, amenities, transport routes and most importantly whether distance from the city centre plays a role in driving this.  \n",
    "3) **Google Trends**: This data would act as one of the features where we try to do regerssion analysis for predicting the rent price for each apartment. The hypothesis would be that google trends for a search for an apartment to rent in a particular neighborhood would affect the pricing for the rentals. The analysis performed in the subsequent report would test this hypothesis.  \n",
    "4) **Crimes**: This data would act as additional filtering for users looking to rent an apartment as well as drive the clustering of the districts as planned in point 2 above. It would be intersting to use visualizatin techniques again to find out if crimes are related to the geograhphical attributes of a particular neighborhood.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall the aim is to aid people looking for rentals in Dublin city and help them filter out neighborhoods and properties based on their preferences as well as other local factors driving their decision making.  \n",
    "Apart from that, the visualiztion techniques used for analysing different datasets would help certain stakeholders make decisions in terms of government planning, business marketing decisions as well as general readers looking for some insights of their own city! "
